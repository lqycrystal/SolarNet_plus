## Datasets
We trained our networks on [RID dataset](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/1655470) 
Here, we regenerate the annotation mask that has three channels. The first channel is the roof segmentation map, the second channel is the roof orientation map, and the third channel is the roof superstructure map. The sample data are provided in the folder ['dlcode/wbf_data/train/seg/3_3_5.png']
